## Backstory

A maintenance company ABC for the turnstile is planning to schedule a maintenance for New York City MTA (The Metropolitan Transportation Authority)
stations in October 2019. Since NYC Subway is one of the world’s largest underground lines, it is very important to do the maintenance with minimum 
effect on the station to prevent any inconvenient. Therefore, ABC company asked me as free lancer data analytics to determine the best 16 days in October
and the best time of the day to do the maintenance knowing that ABC company will work 4 hours in each station but any time in the day.


My work in this project is to clean, explore, aggregate, and visualize the data of same month as previous years to determine the days 
where the stations have the lowest crowed as will as the time of the day. Therefore, from MTA turnstile data I will use the data of October 2018, 2017, and 2016 
and my focus will be mainly on C/A, UNIT, STATION, DATE, TIME, ENTRIES and EXITS columns from the data.

## Question/need:
- What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?

     What are the best days and times to do maintenance for turnstile depending on previous data? 
- Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

     NYC MTA and ABC company.
