# MTA Turnstile Data to schedule Maintenance for turnstile
The goal of this project is to use the data of NYC MTA Turnstile to find the largest station among the 375 stations which has the largest number of turnstiles in New York to schedule maintenance in October 2019. Therefore, choosing the correct data is an important step to make use of it. The maintenance should be done when the station has the lowest number of people, to avoid any inconvenient for the people who use the station. Also, as the number of people during the maintenance is low this will lower the probably of injuries. Therefore, doing such analysis is very important for the maintenance company and MTA as will.
