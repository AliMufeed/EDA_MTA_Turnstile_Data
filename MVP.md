# MVP for project 1 
Prediction of the lowest crouded dates in October 2019 to do maintinace.

The goal of this project is to find the best days to do maintenance on the turnstiles in October 2019 at the 6 most crowded station, by analyzing the data of the previous 3 years (Oct 2016, Oct 2017, Oct 2018) and finding the days that have the lowest number of people entering the each station.

To start exploring this goal, I have chosen a turnstile in the most crowded station which is 34 ST-PENN STA Station, and I plotted the number of Entries for the past 3 years versus the day of the month at the same figure to make it easier for comparing and visualizing.

The figure above has three plots with different colors, each plot represents a year starting from 2016 to 2018. we can notice that each plot has 2 days where the number of entries drops sharply, after checking these dates they were weekends.

the result suggests that the maintenance for the turnstile N067/R012/00-00-00/34 ST-PENN STA should be in the first weekend of oct 2019, because it has the lowest number of people who use it.
